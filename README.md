Study project using ASP.NET
In order to develop ourselves, we create a project that will be written on a three-layer architecture. ASP.NET backend and Angular2 + frontend technologies are used. The goals of this project are to:
+ Track discounts on American marketplaces.
+ Receive all product information.
+ Use this information for personal use to place products on sale in our website.
+ Prices should be converted into Belarusian rubles with reference to the exchange rate.
+ Prices should include the cost of shipping a unit of goods.
+ Prices should contain 15% profit.
If any product does not contain a discount, it is not displayed in the interface of the website.
We will take as a basis a website called 6pm.com.
